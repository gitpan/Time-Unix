NAME
    Time::Unix - Force time() to return seconds since UNIX epoch

SYNOPSIS
       use Time::Unix;     # time() now returns UNIX epoch seconds

DESCRIPTION
    This module does one thing: It imports a new version of time() that
    returns seconds since the UNIX epoch on ALL platforms. It is intended
    mainly as a proof-of-concept for the below Perl 6 RFC.

    In addition to importing a time() function, it also imports a systime()
    function which gives you direct access to the system's native epoch
    (i.e., what time() would return if you hadn't used this module).

    This doesn't do anything useful on UNIX platforms, so don't do that.
